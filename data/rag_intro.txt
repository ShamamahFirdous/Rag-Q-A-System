RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique that combines information retrieval with large language models to generate more accurate and grounded responses.

Instead of relying only on what the model learned during training, RAG retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base and uses them as context when generating answers.

A typical RAG pipeline has two main steps:
1. Retrieval – finding the most relevant chunks of information using vector embeddings.
2. Generation – using a language model to generate an answer based on the retrieved content.

RAG is especially useful when working with private data, domain-specific knowledge, or frequently changing information.
