RAG is widely used in real-world applications where accuracy and up-to-date information are important.

Common applications of RAG include:
- Question answering systems over internal documents
- Chatbots for customer support
- Knowledge assistants for companies
- Legal and medical information systems
- Research assistants for summarizing papers
- AI tools that answer questions over PDFs, databases, or manuals

By using retrieval, RAG reduces hallucinations and allows models to cite their sources.
